class EncoderCacheManager:
    """Manages caching of encoder outputs for multimodal models in vLLM V1.

    The EncoderCacheManager handles the lifecycle of multimodal encoder outputs
    (such as vision embeddings from images) during request processing. It
    provides memory-aware caching to avoid recomputing encoder outputs when the
    same multimodal inputs appear in different stages of request processing.

    This manager is particularly important for:
    - Vision-language models (e.g., LLaVA) where image encoder outputs are
      cached
    - Any multimodal model where encoder computation is expensive and
      cacheable

    The cache operates at the granularity of individual multimodal input items
    within requests, allowing for fine-grained memory management and enabling
    chunked processing of multimodal inputs.

    Cache is enabled to share embeddings of same multimodal data
    item (identified by their hash value) between different requests,
    and eviction takes place at allocation time when there's no free
    space for new embeddings.
    Oldest cached embeddings with no request referenced will be first evicted.

    NOTE: The EncoderCacheManager operates on the level of multimodal embeddings
    instead of encoder tokens (i.e. all tokens that represent the multimodal data
    in the input sequence). This means all break/text tokens in-between multimodal
    embeddings are not considered with respect to the cache size and the number
    of free slots.

    Args:
        cache_size: Limit the size of the cache, measured by the number of
                    encoder embeddings from the input sequence.

    Attributes:
        cache_size: Total cache capacity in encoder embeddings.
        num_free_slots: Current available cache capacity in encoder embeddings.
        num_freeable_slots: Capacity that can be immediately reclaimed by
            evicting entries with zero references (in encoder embeddings).
        cached: Mapping from mm_hash to a set of request IDs that currently
            reference the cached entry. If the set is empty, the entry exists
            but is not referenced by any request and is eligible for
            reclamation.
        freeable: List of tuples (mm_hash, num_encoder_embeds) representing entries
            whose no current running request is needed and that can be freed to
            make space when needed.
        freed: List of mm_hash strings that were actually evicted since the
            last call to get_freed_mm_hashes(). This list is cleared on return.
